# C-Prime-and-Semi-Prime-Numbers

.Net 4.5.2

This small C# console application outputs prime and semi prime numbers within a specified limit

Every thing is commented so that it is easier to understand what every step of the code is doing

So a prime number is a nubmer that is only divisible by itself and 1

For e.g [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] 

A semi prime number is a product of two prime numbers, where the two primes can be equal, meaning it also includes squares of prime numbers.
For e.g. [4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26]

So, how do we calculate it exactly?
